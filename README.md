# LearningKotlin
This repository was made so i could commit the work i have been doing (in my own time) with Kotlin.
I have made this following various tutorials online as well as reading up on the syntax.
This was not intended to be a tutorial for normal users to follow as i haven't gone into much detail in my comments.
This was intended as a source for me to use when creating my first project using kotlin.
